# joaoopereira/devcontainer

Welcome to the my DevContainer Project! This repository contains the configuration and setup for my development container environment.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a consistent and reproducible development environment using Docker containers. By using a dev container, I can ensure the same development setup independent on my machine or Operating system.

## Features

- **Consistent Development Environment**: Ensures all my machines use the same tools and dependencies.
- **Isolation**: Keeps my development environment isolated from your local machine.
- **Reproducibility**: Easily recreate the development environment on any machine.
